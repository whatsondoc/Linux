Intended workflow:       

START
   \	
	|__ Edit the File_Conversion.sbatch script to ensure variables are set, and all necessary application flags are in place
	|
	|__ Prepare a file list for use with the sbatch submission script 
	|	\__ Calculate the length of this file list to use with the Slurm job array indices
	|	|	\__ For example: $ cat /path/to/input/file.list | wc -l
	|	|	\__ This will return a solitary number to the terminal, e.g. 148 
	|	\__ This file list will be passed as the first positional argument to the sbatch submission script (see example below)
	|
	|__ Submit the job array (with file list) via Slurm, as per the example below
	|
	|___ COMPLETE


Example submission:
	$ sbatch --array=0-147 File_Conversion.sbatch /path/to/input/file.list

Notes/Caveats:
	- This has been written to be executed via Slurm, as a job array

	- The original script was written to perform the conversion within a container image, however this is not an absolute requirement

	- If the script will be executed on a different hardware platform, it may be necessary to review the numactl section to ensure computational resources are being used, and used effectively
	
	â€“ The sbatch submission script, as is, assumes a compute node hardware layout with 2 numa domains.

	- Some validation will need to be made to ensure the command(s) being issued in the script function as expected
