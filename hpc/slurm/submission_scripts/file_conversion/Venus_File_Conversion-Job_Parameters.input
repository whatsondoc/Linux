# Path to the file list with output paths for processed input files:
        OUTPUT_PATH_LIST:               /path/to/output/file/list.txt

# The path to the output file (including file name, with Slurm-relevant expressions), for logging both stdout and stderr.
# If you change the filename (as opposed to the path), there may be an incorrect reading from the file in the Alpha_File_Conversion-Executor.sh file to determine task success:
